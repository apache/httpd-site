# The Number One HTTP Server On The Internet
The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP
standards.

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") was launched in 1995 and it has been the most popular web server on the Internet since
April 1996. It has celebrated its 25th birthday as a project in February 2020.

The Apache HTTP Server is a project of [The Apache Software
Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).
