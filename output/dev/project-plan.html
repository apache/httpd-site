<H1>Apache Server Project Plan</H1>
<hr>
<p><strong>THIS DOCUMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING UPDATED. PLANS POST 2.0 ARE STILL FUZZY! </strong>
<p><hr>

<p>

This document aims to encapsulate our plans for world domination, uh,
I mean, further work on the Apache web server.  This is simply a
statement of goals, is always subject to change, and should not be
relied upon for business or mission-critical purposes.  Nothing is
guaranteed.

<H2>2.0</H2>

<UL>
 <LI>Multithreaded/Multiprocess hybrid
 <LI>An Apache runtime library
 <LI>Shared memory pools
 <LI>Absolute Enforcement of an "Apache Style" for code.
 <LI>Updated Configure/build/make process (autoconf?)
 <LI>Configuration API, so that different configuration loaders can be written (Perl, Java, etc.)
 <LI>More API hooks:
  <UL>
	<LI>Post config-read; so we can check consistency between
          directives and abort the startup
       	
	<LI>Per child init
        
	<LI>Per child die
        
	<LI>Pre-handler; which asks round what could *potentially* be served on a URI;
          gets back a list of possible internal redirects with the mime-type/lang/charset
          and quality values.
        
	<LI>Up to 4 placeholders for future use ?
  </UL>
 <LI>Logging enhancements
  <UL>
   <LI>Separate logs for stderr and server error messages
   <LI>Enable all virtual hosts to error-log to the same log, in ways 
	which distinguish entries.
   <LI>Syslog, with different debugging levels, a la named or sendmail
  </UL>
 <LI>Fully 1.1 compliant proxy module.
 <LI>Protocol abstraction layer, so that different protocol implementations can be distributed as a module.
</UL>

<H2>2.1</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Check returns from all system calls: read, write, etc. 
<LI>Nicer Access Control (allow "OneOf","AND","OR" ala NCSA)
<LI>Named Access Methods
<LI>Implementation of the "LINK" Method 
<LI>Authentication API, to make authentication type and database 
type orthogonal
<LI>Next-generation content negotiation support
<LI>Data store abstraction API?  So we're not always presuming we sit on top of a filesystem.
<LI>Enable logging of all "POST"ed data - for commercial-database-like
backups and replay ability. 
<LI>Support for CERN-style imagemaps?  http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/User/CGI/HTImageDoc.html#config.
<LI>give an "Option", like "IncludesNoExec", except allow for CGI includes,
not CMD includes.
<LI>Serious dynamic loading support, so that binary distributions can have all
 modules compiled and can be used even by folks without compilers of their own.
<LI>Standardized PUT support, at least a perl script included with the distribution.
</UL>

<H2>3.0</H2>
<UL>
 <LI>HTTP-NG
</UL>
