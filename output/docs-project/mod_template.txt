<usage>

<p>Only the block tags p, example, note, blockquote, ul, and ol can be
used directly under usage.  The pre tag is also allowed, but its use
is discourage.  Inside a paragraph, the tags em, strong, a, code,
directive, module, and br are allowed.</p>

<p>The directive tag (when the module attribute is given) and the
module tag automatically create links.  For "section" directives like
&lt;Directory&gt;, a special format is used: <directive module="core"
type="section">Directory</directive>.  The angle brackets will be
added automatically for display.</p>

<p>The example and note tag have optional &lt;title&gt;s.  The note
tag also has a "type" attribute that can be set to "warning".</p>

<p>All content must be well-formed xml.  This means closing tags must
be used in the correct places, and unclosed tags must be written as such:
&lt;br /&gt;.</p>
</usage>

<!-- Any number of seealso references can be used for each directive -->
<seealso><directive module="template.xml">Location</directive></seealso>
</directivesynopsis>

<!-- If a directive from this module is documented in another module,
then a special format of the directivesynopsis tag can be used to
reference it. -->
<directivesynopsis location="othermodule">
<name>OtherDirective</name>
</directivesynopsis>

<!-- If the directive marks a "section" like Directory, Location, etc,
another special format is used -->
<directivesynopsis type="section">
<!-- The angle brackets are *not* included in the name.  They will be
added automatically for display -->
<name>Location</name>
<!-- Continue as before -->
