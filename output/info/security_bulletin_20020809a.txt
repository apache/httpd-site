=============== SUMMARY ================

        Title: Apache 2.0 vulnerability affects non-Unix platforms
         Date: 9th August 2002
     Revision: 2
 Product Name: Apache HTTP server 2.0
  OS/Platform: Windows, OS2, Netware
Permanent URL: http://httpd.apache.org/info/security_bulletin_20020809a.txt
  Vendor Name: Apache Software Foundation
   Vendor URL: http://httpd.apache.org/
      Affects: All Released versions of 2.0 through 2.0.39
     Fixed in: 2.0.40
  Identifiers: CVE-2002-0661

=============== DESCRIPTION ================

Apache is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and freely-available Web
server.  On the 7th August 2002, The Apache Software Foundation was
notified of the discovery of a significant vulnerability, identified by
Auriemma Luigi <bugtest@sitoverde.com>.

This vulnerability has the potential to allow an attacker to inflict
serious damage to a server, and reveal sensitive data.  This vulnerability
affects default installations of the Apache web server.

Unix and other variant platforms appear unaffected.  Cygwin users are
likely to be affected.

=============== SOLUTION ================

A simple one line workaround in the httpd.conf file will close the
vulnerability.  Prior to the first 'Alias' or 'Redirect' directive, add
the following directive to the global server configuration:

   RedirectMatch 400 "\\\.\."

Fixes for this vulnerability are also included in Apache HTTP server
version 2.0.40.  The 2.0.40 release also contains fixes for two minor
path-revealing exposures.  This release of Apache is available at
http://downloads.apache.org/httpd/

More information will be made available by the Apache Software
Foundation and Auriemma Luigi <bugtest@sitoverde.com> in the
coming weeks.
