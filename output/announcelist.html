<H1>Join the Apache Announcements Mailing List</H1>

The <CODE>announce@apache.org</CODE> mailing list has been set up to inform
people of new code releases, bug fixes, security fixes, and general
news and information about the Apache server.  Most of this
information will also be posted to comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix,
but this provides a more timely way of accessing that information.
The mailing list is one-way, announcements only.

<P>

To subscribe, send a message (blank, or anything, doesn't matter) to
<CODE><STRONG>announce-subscribe@apache.org</STRONG></CODE>.  You'll
get back a confirmation message with instructions on how to validate
your subscription.
